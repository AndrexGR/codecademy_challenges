#### Here is the context for codecademy [**"Capturing Rainwater"**][ref1] Challenge project. Two results, provided in the forum by **@steffan153** (1) and by **@aronkleinhans** (2), can be seen at _capturing_rainwater_1.js_ and _capturing_rainwater_2.js_, respectively.

#### The first has a strong mathematical approach, whereas the second goes for pointers and bounds. Both are nice codes.

##  **Capturing Rainwater**
---

Create a **_capturingRainwater()_** function that takes in an array of heights, and returns the amount of rainwater that could be contained in that array.

For example, the array **[4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2]** can be represented in the following histogram:

![Histogram][img1]

As you can see, there are 6 units of water that can be contained, so **_capturingRainwater([4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2])_** will return **6**.
